## User stories:
- I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
- I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
- I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
- I can edit these recipes.
- I can delete these recipes.
- All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

###### Thx to <a href="http://codepen.io/pnahratow/" target="_blank">Philipp Nahratow</a> for providing Inspiration and a Solution for indexing the Recipes!
